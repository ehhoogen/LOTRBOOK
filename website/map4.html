    Rhûn refers to the little-known lands in eastern Middle-earth.
    Almost nothing of the lands beyond the great Sea of Rhûn is known.
    The first Elves awoke far east of the Sea of Rhûn, and many of them were led to the Westlands by Oromë.
    Some Elves forsook this Great Journey and chose to remain in the east; they were called the Avari.
    The first Men also awoke in the far east, where they first met Dwarves and Avari.
    The ancestors of the Edain and Drúedain traveled west out of Rhûn.
    At the shores of the Sea of Rhûn, some of the Mannish tribes traveling west separated and their languages soon diverged.
    Other men remained in Rhûn, and many of them came under the dominion of Morgoth and, later, Sauron.
    These men were called Easterlings, and they led many attacks against Gondor and its allies during the Third Age.
    Dwarves emerged in Middle-earth in the Years of the Trees; after Elves but before Men.
    When the Seven Fathers of the Dwarves awoke in far-flung corners of Middle-earth, some of them found themselves in Rhûn, and there they founded kingdoms under the mountains of the East.
    The distance between their mansions in the East and the Misty Mountains, specifically Gundabad, was said to be as great or greater than that of Gundabad's distance from the Blue Mountains in the West.
    These four clans are the Ironfists, Stiffbeards, Blacklocks and Stonefoots.
    In the Third Age, Dwarves of those kingdoms journeyed out of Rhûn to join all Middle-earth's other Dwarf clans in the War of the Dwarves and Orcs, which was fought in and under the Misty Mountains.
    After this war, the survivors returned home.
    Late in the Third Age, when war and terror grew in Rhûn itself, considerable numbers of its Dwarves left their ancient homelands.
    They sought refuge in Middle-earth's western lands, where some of them met Frodo Baggins.
