    The Shire

    The Shire is described as a small but beautiful and fruitful land, beloved by its inhabitants.
    The Hobbits had an extensive agricultural system in the Shire, but did not proceed with industrialisation.
    Various supplies could be found in the Shire, including cereals, fruit, wood and pipe-weed.
    The Shire was quite densely populated in parts with many villages and a few towns, but it still was open enough to allow for wide forested areas and marshes.
    There were green, rolling hills and freshly tilled earth, along with gardens and flower boxes on window sills.
    The Shire was a fertile and well-tilled part of Arnor, but deserted during the waning days of the Kingdom when it was known as the splinter-realm of Arthedain; it had been the hunting grounds of the King of Arnor.
    The Hobbits (who lived in Dunland and parts of depopulated Cardolan and Rhudaur) got official permission from King Argeleb II at Norbury (Fornost) to settle the lands.
    This was finally done in Third Age 1601 (Year 1 in Shire Reckoning) by Hobbits from Bree, led by the brothers Marcho and Blanco.
    Its small size, relative lack of importance, and brave and resilient Hobbit population made it too modest an objective for conquest.
    More important was that the Shire was guarded and protected by the DÃºnedain Rangers of the North (and Gandalf), who watched the borders and kept out intruders.
